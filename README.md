# Programming for Linguistics and Literature

This repository holds the teaching materials for the 'Programming for Linguistics and Literature' ('Programmeren voor de Taal- en Letterkunde') course at the University of Antwerp (2015FLWTAA) in the academic year 2016-2017. For this course, we will make use of so-called [notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html). Follow the instructions below to install all the software required for this course. Additionally, we recommend to install the free, cross-platform text editor [Sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com/), which is always safe to fall back on, shouldn't you be able to get the IPython notebooks to work. This course heavily builds upon the teaching materials provided in the ['Python for the Humanities'](http://fbkarsdorp.github.io/python-course/) course by F. Karsdorp et al. A preliminary teaching schedule, for this course is available below. Practical questions related to this course should be sent to [mike.kestemont(at[uantwerp]dot)be] and/or [walter.daelemans(at[uantwerp]dot)be], including the solutions to the weekly programming assignments (see below). Note that, each week, students are encouraged to prepare the chapters for the next week.

## Preliminary schedule
This course starts with ca. 7 contact sessions that offer an introduction to Python programming, as well as more general topics such as the use of the command line and the git version management system. The course materials for these introductory chapters are already included in this repository. Next, there will be 5 sessions that delve into more advanced topics (these materials are still being fine-tuned will be added to the respository as we progress). During each contact session, we will work our way through one or more course chapters, which have to be prepared by the students at home. This preparation includes making the exercices that can be found at the end each chapter. The solution to these has to be submitted on a weekly basis via email, and will be graded (this permanent evaluation will form 20% of the final grade). Our schedule runs as follows:

### Part 1: Introduction to Python
1. Friday 30/09/2016: Introduction, installation and 'Variables' (Chapter 1)
2. Friday 07/10/2016: 'Collections' (Chapter 2) and 'Conditions' (Chapters 2 and 3)
3. Friday 21/20/2016: NO SESSION (prepare Chapter 4)
4. Friday 28/10/2016: 'Loops' (Chapter 4)
5. Friday 04/11/2016: 'Functions and Files' (Chapter 5) and 'Regular expressions' (Chapter 6)
6. Friday 11/11/2016: Armistice Day: NO SESSION; prepare 'More on loops' (Chapter 7)
7. Friday 18/11/2016: Github and the command line (Guest course by E. Manjavacas-Arévallo)

### Part 2: Advanced topics 
8. Friday 25/11/2016: 'Text representation'
9. Friday 02/12/2016: 'Stylometry' (part 1)
10. Friday 09/12/2016: 'Stylometry' (part 2)
11. Friday 16/12/2016: 'Named Entity Recognition'
12. Friday 23/12/2016: Example Project: The [CLIN 2017 Shared Task on Translating Historical Text](http://ifarm.nl/clin2017st/g)

### Part 3: Project work
The final examination for this course takes the form of a (group) project that the students will have to develop on GitHub (ca. 1000 lines of code per team member). The topic can be anything, but the project must aim to solve a task in the field of digital literary studies and/or computational linguistics. An oral defence moment for each project will be organized during the official examination period. The final project will count for 80% of the mark for this course.

## Installation instructions

First, we will install Python, the programming language which we will use throughout this course. We will make use of the free Anaconda distribution, which has all the packages we need built in. Important: we will use Python 3.5 in this course, so make sure NOT to install Python 2.*. Follow these steps:

- Go to [http://continuum.io/downloads](http://continuum.io/downloads)
- Download the Graphical Installer **FOR PYTHON 3.5** in the top-right corner.
- Run the Graphical installer (if you run into problems, check out [the help page](http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install.html) or contact the course's tutors.)

Issue the following command in your command line console (and hit enter after the command):

On Windows:
- conda create -n py35 python=3.5 anaconda

Other platforms:
- conda create -n py35 python=3.5 anaconda

Download the course folder for this course, by clicking "Download ZIP" in the right column of the present page. Save and extract this ZIP folder to a convenient location, such as your `/Desktop`. You should now be able to launch the interactive IPython notebooks in your browser. Open the unzipped folder and:

- Under Windows: double-click "start-windows.bat"
- Under Mac OSX: double-click "start-osx.command"
- Under Linux: double-click "start-unix.sh"

After double-clicking this file once, this should open your browser (preferably Google Chrome or Firefox) on a page http://127.0.0.1:8888/ (or something similar) which says `IP[y]: Notebook`. (Note that this might take a while on slower machines, so don't panic if this page doesn't show up immediately.) If for some reason, the notebook is opened by Internet Explorer, copy the URL and paste that in either Google Chrome or Firefox. If none of this worked, feel free to drop me an email.

## Executing code via Sublime text

It has often happened in the past that students were able to install Python and the Anaconda distribution, but that they encountered difficulties when launching the actual notebooks for this course. Note that you are always able to consult the notebooks materuals in a static version, using the links listed below. In the text editor Sublime text you can simply copy or write Python code and execute the code by pressing `Ctrl+b` on a Windows/Linux machine, or `Cmd+b` on Mac OS X. Make sure that that you save your code files with a `.py` extension, before running the code.
